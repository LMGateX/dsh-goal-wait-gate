/**
 * Whether the session owns any live subagent descendant at any depth.
 *
 * Liveness is the live agent registry, not the durable child catalog: a
 * settled child is no longer registered, and a child that merely exists as a
 * session record must not hold continuation. Only sessions whose header names
 * a parent and carries the subagent origin are descendants; a fork shares the
 * lineage field without that origin and is an independent conversation.
 *
 * Every registered descendant counts, including one between turns. The
 * official archive-admission walk traverses the same lineage but collects only
 * `status === "running"` children, because a session may be archived once its
 * idle children are cancelled. For this gate the unit is the live activation
 * epoch, not the child's current turn: a resident child has not settled, so
 * its settlement notice has not reached the parent, and releasing early would
 * let the official driver inject a round before that notice is consumed.
